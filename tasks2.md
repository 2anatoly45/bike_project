============

TO DO:

1. Convert total time to hours, minutes and seconds;
2. Test algorithm for velocity;
3. Add the option to pause when taking a break to leave average speed unaffected;
4. Make the arduino store two times: total time spent outside and time spent travelling;
5. Write an equivalent printer function for LCD;

To follow up with the previous concern, code execution is quick enough 
for all magnet contacts to be perceived by the sensors. You would have to go at
193.5km/h for that to be a problem.
