============

// Add here what you think is important

TO DO:

1. Write a printer function;
2. Convert time to hours, minutes and seconds;
3. Write algorithm for velocity;
4. Add the option to pause when taking a break to leave average speed unaffected;
5. Make the arduino store two times: total time spent outside and time spent travelling;
6. Add the possibility to change modes with the mode button;
7. Add the option to adjust wheel diamter in inches (which will be converted to metres);
8. Write an equivalent printer function for LCD;
//
9. Add a "maximum speed" variable (might have to be careful about what interval of time is picked for measuring it);
